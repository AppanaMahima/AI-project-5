weird words jobbernowl 3 beyond words 4 qa chip off the old block bells and whistles mortarboard 5 endnote 6 subscription commands 7 contact addresses 1 turns of phrase beanpole family historically families have usually had more children than parents resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids however in recent years especially in countries like britain and the us the number of children per generation has steadily gone down while life span has increased this has led to a shape of family tree that some researchers have likened to a beanpole tall and thin with few people in each generation the term beanpole family has been around in the academic literature at least since 1987 but it rarely appears elsewhere a recent british report has brought it to wider public notice at least in the uk some researchers find it too slangy and prefer the jargon term verticalised to describe such families whatever term you prefer specialists are sure that the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal relationships within the family and for example the role of grandparents the rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the beanpole family with almost one in two marriages ending in divorce many adults have at least two families each with a single child observer may 2002 noting the rising number of socalled beanpole families in britain families with only one child the report warns that a child without siblings is starved of the companionship of family members of their own age leading to greater social isolation with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life guardian june 2002 2 weird words jobbernowl a stupid person a blockhead unfortunately this useful and effective insult has rather dropped out of use in these mealymouthed times the last excursion for it that i can find is in the classic w c fields film the bank dick of 1940 in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line surely dont be a luddieduddie dont be a mooncalf dont be a jabbernow youre not those are you before that it turns up in one of the novels of hall caine in 1890 but even by then it seems to have been rather rare its from the old french jobard from jobe silly that word was then added to noll the top or crown of the head the noddle the first sense was of a blocklike or stupidlooking head but was soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within jobbernowlism is the condition or state of being a jobbernowl or an act or remark that is especially stupid careful how you use it the recipient might be a subscriber 3 beyond words ive been away at a heritage conference in colchester these past few days on my way back my eye was caught by this warning sign posted above some steps at the local railway station caution do not run on the stairs use the hand rail 4 qa q for my job i have to read american magazines concerning consumer electronics home systems burglar alarms etc i very often come across the expression bells and whistles which seem to relate to equipment accessories or features that are offered to the customer as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work is that right and where does that funny phrase come from herve castelain france q youre right about the meaning of this phrase which refers to gimmicks nonessential but often engaging features added to a piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function the phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the american military at least one of its earliest appearances was in an article in atlantic in october 1982 which said it was pentagon slang for extravagant frills theres some evidence that the term has actually been around since the 1960s but the early evidence is sparse where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate a literal sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth century referring to streetcars railways and steamships before modern electronics there were really only two ways to make a loud warning noise you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle steam made the latter a real power in the land anybody who has heard the noisy outoftune calliope on the steamboat natchez at new orleans will agree about its power though less so about its glory and at one time clang clang clang went the trolley in large numbers of american cities at least some early us railroad locomotives had both bells and whistles as this extract from an article in appletons journal of 1876 shows you look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping along the edge of a precipice twothirds up the rocky height a train of redandyellow railwaycars drawn by two woodburning engines the sound of whose bells and whistles seems like the small diversions of very little children so diminished are they by the distance could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought excessive a case of belt and braces an unnecessary feature a frill possibly but its more probable the slang sense of the term comes from that close musical relative of the calliope the theatre organ extraordinary instruments such as the mighty wurlitzer augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to help the organist accompany silent films among them car horns sirens and bird whistles these effects were called toys and organs often had toy counters with 20 or more noisemakers on them including various bells and whistles in the 1950s decades after the talkies came in but while theatre organs were still common in big movie houses these fun features must have been considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but mere fripperies inessential addons its possible the slang sense grew out of that it got taken up especially by the computing industry perhaps because opportunities to add them are so great q the designation of robes for academic dress clearly comes from its origin with the clergy in the middle ages but what about mortarboards the best i could find was its origin in the 12th or 13th century clergy cap but that was not squareshaped does mortarboard refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient a the academic cap often called a mortarboard is quite ancient but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth century a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a square the literal mortar board is the wooden plate usually with a handle underneath on which bricklayers carry small amounts of mortar a similar tool is used by plasterers but they usually call it a hawk what seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between the brickies board and the academic cap led some wag probably at oxford university to apply the name of the one to the other our first recorded use is in a book of 18536 the adventures of mr verdant green an oxford freshman by a clergyman named edward bradley who wrote under the pen name of cuthbert bede the names of the two patron saints of durham where he went to school verdant green is a sort of undergraduate pickwick and the book recounts his adventures this magisterial reprimand by a don appears after one such escapade i will overlook your offence in assuming that portion of the academical attire to which you gave the offensive epithet of mortarboard more especially as you acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have known better after a slow start the book became a huge success selling more than 200000 copies in the next 20 years whether mr bradley invented the slang term we may never know but his book certainly popularised it q i got into a discussion about chip off the old block with friends and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting jewelry making woodworking or none of the above what does this term mean and where did it come from vijay renganathan a the associations are with carpentry and the block is definitely made of wood the first form of the expression was chip of the same block meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as somebody or something else so from the same source or parentage an early example is in a sermon by dr robert sanderson at one time bishop of lincoln dated 1637 am not i a child of the same adam a chip of the same block with him later that century another form is recorded a chip of the old block which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his father or continued some family characteristic at some point probably late in the nineteenth century this was modified to a chip off the old block which does nothing to change the sense but is the way its now usually written or said 5 endnote the sum of human wisdom is not contained in any one language and no single language is capable of expressing
